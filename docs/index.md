### Features
- Supports many DBMS üíæ
  - Currently, SQLite and PostgreSQL are functional - more to come! 
- Easily extendable to [multi-modal usecases](reference/examples/vqa-ingredient) üñºÔ∏è
- Smart parsing optimizes what is passed to external functions üß†
  - Traverses abstract syntax tree with [sqlglot](https://github.com/tobymao/sqlglot) to minimize LLM function calls üå≥
- Constrained decoding with [guidance](https://github.com/guidance-ai/guidance) üöÄ
- LLM function caching, built on [diskcache](https://grantjenks.com/docs/diskcache/) üîë

BlendSQL is a *superset of SQLite* for problem decomposition and hybrid question-answering with LLMs. 

As a result, we can *Blend* together...

- ü•§ ...operations over heterogeneous data sources (e.g. tables, text, images)
- ü•§ ...the structured & interpretable reasoning of SQL with the generalizable reasoning of LLMs

It can be viewed as an inversion of the typical text-to-SQL paradigm, where a user calls a LLM, and the LLM calls a SQL program.

**Now, the user is given the control to oversee all calls (LLM + SQL) within a unified query language.**

As shown in our paper, using BlendSQL as an intermediate representation for complex reasoning tasks can <b>boost performance by 8.63%</b> and <b>use 35% fewer tokens</b> compared to the naive end-to-end approach. For an example of this approach, see [this notebook](reference/examples/teaching-blendsql-via-in-context-learning).

For example, imagine we have the following tables.

### `w`
| **date** | **rival**                 | **city**  | **venue**                   | **score** |
|----------|---------------------------|-----------|-----------------------------|-----------|
| 31 may   | nsw waratahs              | sydney    | agricultural society ground | 11-0      |
| 5 jun    | northern districts        | newcastle | sports ground               | 29-0      |
| 7 jun    | nsw waratahs              | sydney    | agricultural society ground | 21-2      |
| 11 jun   | western districts         | bathurst  | bathurst ground             | 11-0      |
| 12 jun   | wallaroo & university nsw | sydney    | cricket ground              | 23-10     |

### `documents`
| **title**                      | **content**                                       |

BlendSQL allows us to ask the following questions by injecting "ingredients", which are callable functions denoted by double curly brackets (`{{`, `}}`).
The below examples work out of the box, but you are able to design your own ingredients as well! 

*What was the result of the game played 120 miles west of Sydney?*
```sql
SELECT * FROM w
  WHERE city = {{
      LLMQA(
          'Which city is located 120 miles west of Sydney?',
          (SELECT * FROM documents WHERE documents MATCH 'sydney OR 120'),
          options='w::city'
      )
  }}
```

*Which venues in Sydney saw more than 30 points scored?*
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT venue FROM w
  WHERE city = 'sydney' AND {{
      LLMMap(
          'More than 30 total points?',
          'w::score'
      )
  }} = TRUE
```

*Show all NSW Waratahs games and a description of the team.*
```sql
SELECT date, rival, score, documents.content AS "Team Description" FROM w
  JOIN {{
      LLMJoin(
          left_on='documents::title',
          right_on='w::rival'
      )
  }} WHERE rival = 'nsw waratahs'
```
