BlendSQL is a *superset of SQLite* for problem decomposition and hybrid question-answering with LLMs. 

As a result, we can *Blend* together...

- ü•§ ...operations over heterogeneous data sources (e.g. tables, text, images)
- ü•§ ...the structured & interpretable reasoning of SQL with the generalizable reasoning of LLMs

It can be viewed as an inversion of the typical text-to-SQL paradigm, where a user calls a LLM, and the LLM calls a SQL program.

**Now, the user is given the control to oversee all calls (LLM + SQL) within a unified query language.**

For example, imagine we have the following table titled `parks`, containing [info on national parks in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_parks_of_the_United_States).

We can use BlendSQL to build a travel planning LLM chatbot to help us navigate the options below.


| **Name**        | **Image**                                                                   | **Location**       | **Area**                          | **Recreation Visitors (2022)** | **Description**                                                                                                                          |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Death Valley    | ![death_valley.jpeg](./img/national_parks_example/death_valley.jpeg)     | California, Nevada | 3,408,395.63 acres (13,793.3 km2) | 1,128,862                      | Death Valley is the hottest, lowest, and driest place in the United States, with daytime temperatures that have exceeded 130 ¬∞F (54 ¬∞C). |
| Everglades      | ![everglades.jpeg](./img/national_parks_example/everglades.jpeg)         | Alaska             | 7,523,897.45 acres (30,448.1 km2) | 9,457                          | The country's northernmost park protects an expanse of pure wilderness in Alaska's Brooks Range and has no park facilities.              |
| New River Gorge | ![new_river_gorge.jpeg](./img/national_parks_example/new_river_gorge.jpeg) | West Virgina       | 7,021 acres (28.4 km2)            | 1,593,523                      | The New River Gorge is the deepest river gorge east of the Mississippi River.                                                            |
 | Katmai          | ![katmai.jpg](./img/national_parks_example/katmai.jpg)                  | Alaska             |  3,674,529.33 acres (14,870.3 km2)                                 | 33,908 | This park on the Alaska Peninsula protects the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes, an ash flow formed by the 1912 eruption of Novarupta.  |

BlendSQL allows us to ask the following questions by injecting "ingredients", which are callable functions denoted by double curly brackets (`{{`, `}}`).

_Which parks don't have park facilities?_
```sql
SELECT * FROM parks
    WHERE NOT {{
        LLMValidate(
            'Does this location have park facilities?',
            context=(SELECT "Name" AS "Park", "Description" FROM parks),
        )
    }}
```

_What does the largest park in Alaska look like?_

```sql
SELECT {{VQA('Describe this image.', 'parks::Image')}} FROM parks
    WHERE "Location" = 'Alaska'
    ORDER BY {{
        LLMMap(
            'Size in km2?',
            'parks::Area'
        )
    }} LIMIT 1
```

_Which state is the park in that protects an ash flow?_

```sql
SELECT "Location" FROM parks WHERE "Name" = {{
    LLMQA(
      'Which park protects an ash flow?',
      context=(SELECT "Name", "Description" FROM parks),
      options="parks::Name"
    ) 
}}
```

_How many parks are located in more than 1 state?_

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM parks
    WHERE {{LLMMap('How many states?', 'parks::Location')}} > 1
```

Now, we have an intermediate representation for our LLM to use that is explainable, debuggable, and [very effective at hybrid question-answering tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17882).
